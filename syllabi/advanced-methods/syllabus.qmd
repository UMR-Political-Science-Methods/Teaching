## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Apply advanced statistical methods to political science questions
2. Understand and implement causal inference techniques
3. Conduct sophisticated data analysis using R
4. Design and execute original research projects
5. Critically evaluate published research in political science

## Required Materials

- **Textbook:** Advanced Methods for Political Analysis (2nd Edition)
- **Software:** R, RStudio, and additional packages (all free)
- **Articles:** Weekly readings from academic journals (on course website)

## Course Policies

### Attendance and Participation
This is a seminar course where active participation is essential. Students are expected to:

- Attend all classes
- Complete readings before class
- Participate in discussions
- Provide constructive peer feedback

### Problem Sets
Four problem sets will be assigned throughout the semester. These will involve:

- Statistical analysis using R
- Written interpretation of results
- Replication of published research

### Research Project
The final research project involves:

1. **Proposal (Week 6):** Research question, literature review, and design
2. **Presentation (Week 13-14):** Present findings to class
3. **Final Paper (Finals Week):** Full research paper (20-25 pages)

### Academic Integrity
All work must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is allowed but must be acknowledged. Plagiarism will result in course failure and disciplinary action.

### Technology Policy
Laptops are encouraged for note-taking and in-class exercises. Please use technology responsibly.

## Resources

### R Resources
- R for Data Science (online book)
- Stack Overflow and R community forums
- Office hours for coding help

### Writing Support
- University Writing Center
- Citation management tools (Zotero, Mendeley)

### Statistical Consulting
- Department statistical consultant available by appointment

## Schedule of Readings

Detailed reading assignments will be provided on the course website at least one week in advance.
